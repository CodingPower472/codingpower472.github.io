## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

The main problems I had were issues with elements not drawing in the correct region on the screen due to confusing definitions of where the elements were drawn on the screen.  However, my system of frames with a fixed frame rate worked very well.  I didn't have any major moments where everything "clicked" but I had some moments where I felt like I understood programming better.  To create the program, I used StackOverflow and Google and adapted the situations to my specific program.  To research on my own, I had to search on Google, StackOverflow, and W3Schools.  I probably would have planned out what I was going to add before I added it if I went back.  I learned a lot about Canvas elements and making images and shapes be drawn onto the screen in JavaScript.  I got some errors where some elements weren't drawing, but I fixed them by debugging the specific positions of each of them and discovered they were drawing off the screen.  I found it challenging to make my brain work to draw from the top of the screen as 0 instead of the bottom being 0.  This was overall a very fun project and tested my understanding.

## Testing

I opened the project in a web browser and ensured it followed all of the instructions.

## Extra Credit

Snow accumulation?
